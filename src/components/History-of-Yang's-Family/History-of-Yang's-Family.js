                    Yang style is the most widely practised form of Taichi in the world. Many of the offshoots such as Beijing 24 and modified Yang Style are different manifestations based on the traditional form. Yang Lu chan ( 1799- 1872) also known as Yang the Invincible, was the founder of the Yang Style. His art has been handed down for the past 160 years.  Yang Chen Fu ( 1883 – 1936, third generation of Yang family), one of China’s great martial artists, standardised the 85 movements form. In the 1920s, he was captured in photos performing each of the 85 postures. It is this form which is known as authentic Yang style. Yang Cheng Fu’s nephew, Grand master Fu Shong Wen, inherited leadership of Yang style, representing the fourth generation. He was then very health and strong and he was practising Taichi up to his death at the age of 91. Yang Cheng Fu’s grandnephew, Fu Shen Yuan is the fifth generation to receive the entire transmission of the family art. He was the world’s foremost authority on Yang Style Taichi and had many followers throughout the world.  Grandmaster Fu’s son Master Fu Qin Quan (James) is following in his ancestors’ footsteps. He is the sixth generation to inherit the full transmission of authentic Yang family Tai Chi. Master James Fu was the National Chinese champion for Tai Chi weapons in 1988 and for Taichi form in 1989. He has now been awarded a 7th Dan grade by the Chinese Wushu Association.
